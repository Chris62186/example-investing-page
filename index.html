          We're happy to have your interest in investing here in Prosperityville!<br><br>

          As a first step in any development process, we highly encourage you to schedule a <strong>conceptual review meeting</strong>.
          This meeting will help us get to know your project and help you fully understand the development review process here. These meetings are free.
          To schedule this meeting, please reach out to Community Development Director Stanley Finkle at 616-456-3345 or
          <a href = "mailto: abc@example.com">send him an email</a>. While we can schedule these meetings anytime throughout the week, Tuesday
          and Thursday mornings are usually kept free to ensure we can make time. These meetings are optional unless you are requesting approvl
          as a Planned Unit Development, then they are required by the zoning ordinance.<br>

          <p class="header-resource-content">Zoning</p>
          Prosperityville is a zoned community. Zoning is based on the community's <a href="">2018 master plan</a> and helps protect existing development, community character and
          health/human safety - all while still allowing for new development. Zoning consists of two parts: the map and the ordinance text. Use the map to get an idea of your parcel's
          zoning district and then the ordinance to look up regulations for that district. For an official zoning determination letter, contact the Community Development
          Director. He'll also be your point of contact for any zoning questions.<br><br>

          <a href = >Zoning Ordinance</a><br>

          <p class="header-resource-content">Application Forms</p>
          The type of application you'll need depends on the project but if you already know what you need, you can access all our forms online
          <a href => here</a>.

          <p class="header-resource-content">Approval Timelines</p>
          Prosperityville has worked hard to streamline our development review process so projects can get off the ground as quickly as possible. But it is important
          that the process be followed to ensure all development meets local regulations. Many small residential or accesory use projects can be approved administratively,
           usually within <strong>10 days</strong> of a full application. Special land uses require Planning Commission approval and more complex asks like rezoning, PUDs and variances
          go through other routes. See below for a general idea of approval timeframes: <br><br>

          <p class="header-resource-content">Fees</p>
          We know fees are a common question so we've made them easy to find: <a href = "blank">click here</a>. The city prefers fees be paid via cash or check but
          credit cards can be used in the office or over the phone. Under current law, the city is prohibited from paying
          credit card service fees, so the 3% fee must be paid by the user.<br>
